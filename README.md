## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js >= 18 and npm installed.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rafium-MS/designacoes_territorios.git
cd designacoes_territorios
npm install
npm run rebuild
```

Optional: set admin password

```bash
export ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm start
```

When you run the app for the first time it will create a local `db.sqlite`
database in the project directory. All application logs are stored under the
`logs/` folder and any CSV or database backups are saved inside `Backup/`.

### Scraping Territories

```bash
node scripts/scrapeTerritorios.js
```

Set `TERRITORIOS_URL` to change the source URL or `SAVE_TO_DB=true` to insert
the results directly into the local database.
You can also run the scraper inside the application on the **Coleta** screen, which always saves the data.
